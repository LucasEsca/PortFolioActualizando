# Updating Personal Portfolio

It's a website where I document my knowledge and skills in a practical way, for the moment it's only in Spanish.

I consider it special, being my first project, in this one I can have free decision on what to do and experiment without generating problems. 


## Additional Information

The page's layout implements Bootstrap with some CSS. 
The creation and implementation of models and services uses TypeScript.
For the logic and definition of models, services and controllers uses Java
